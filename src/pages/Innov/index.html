          Instructors can upload their course contents to the asset library and create learning modules based on the learning content. Students may engage in self-directed learning by asking questions about their learning content and navigating and visualising the concepts to explore and deepen their understanding of the learning content at their own pace. Based on users' questions, the relevant learning content will be retrieved for the generative AI models to provide the answer. Reference links to the learning content will be provided so that students can validate the factuality of the AI-generated content.

            During the course, students visit the Smart Elderly Home activity, where they experience a system of interconnected appliances, IoT sensors, and video analytics designed to improve safety and enhance the quality of life for senior citizens. During the visit, students have the opportunity to try out the smart devices themselves. They control automated windows and cupboards, operate AI-controlled lighting systems, and experiment with assistive tools that make daily life safer and easier for seniors. By actively engaging with these technologies, students gain firsthand insight into how AI and smart systems can support independent living and healthcare for the elderly.
