          Instructors can upload their course contents to the asset library and create learning modules based on the learning content. Students may engage in self-directed learning by asking questions about their learning content and navigating and visualising the concepts to explore and deepen their understanding of the learning content at their own pace. Based on users' questions, the relevant learning content will be retrieved for the generative AI models to provide the answer. Reference links to the learning content will be provided so that students can validate the factuality of the AI-generated content.

          Students often face tight review schedules before exams, especially when understanding complex concepts. GPTutor includes features for students to generate practice questions of varying difficulty levels based on the course material, helping students reinforce their understanding. The immediate feedback and explanations provide students with timely reinforcement and correction of misunderstandings.

          For healthcare students, clinical reasoning training is crucial for their career practice, but costly to arrange physically. Our simulation-based training tackles our students' need for case-based experience. By incorporating Generative AI, 3D avatars and lip-sync technology, the platform provides an engaging environment for students to apply knowledge and analytical skills in realistic settings, better preparing students for professional challenges after graduation.

          Our platform stands out by providing customizable GenAI-powered patient simulation scenarios specifically designed for optometry students, and we are not aware of any comparable scenario currently available in the market. Students can practice taking case histories, selecting appropriate tests and analysing the results, and then they have to come up with the diagnosis and management plans. Compared to the clinic, it's a low-stress environment where they can learn from mistakes.
