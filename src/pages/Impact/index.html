        Our innovative GPTutor project was shortlisted for <b>2024 QS Reimagine Education Awards</b> in the AI in Education category. Since then, we have made significant progress in enhancing the platform features, developing new simulation scenarios, promoting the platform both within and beyond PolyU, and adopting the platform for learning by students from diverse disciplines. In the past year, over 3,000 students from more than 20 departments and schools have used GPTutor to support their learning across 15+ courses.

          The project was showcased in the "Transformation of Higher Education in the AI Era: Innovation, Best Practices, and Impact" (AIHED) Symposium on 21 May. In the session "Learning and teaching show and tell: Showcasing exemplary use of GenAI in learning, teaching, and assessment practices by students and teachers from the eight UGC-funded universities in Hong Kong", we shared how we use the platform to create virtual patient simulation for the students in School of Optometry and a student from the School of Optometry also shared his learning experience with the platform in the course SO4009 General and Ocular Pharmacology.

            "Using GPTutor feels like having a patient right in front of me which really brings the clinical experience to life. It's helped me connect what I've learned in pharmacology and pathology to real cases, making the learning process more meaningful. As I am still in clinical placements, I find it very reassuring to practice with rare and tricky eye conditions that I might not see throughout my clinical rotations. GPTutor has definitely boosted my confidence and made me feel more prepared to care for real patients."

          <p>We have complemented online learning with experiential learning activities at the PolyU Industrial Centre for AI literacy education. These activities have reached over 1,600 students from more than 20 different programmes, including Occupational Therapy, Radiography, Physiotherapy, Computing & AI, Land Surveying & Geo-Informatics, Applied Social Sciences, Fashion & Textiles, Chinese History & Culture, Biotechnology & Chemical Technology, Food Safety & Technology, Hotel & Tourism Management, Building & Real Estate, among others.</p>
          <p>For the experiential learning activities, our recent survey results show that 89% of the students agree/strongly agree that the experiential learning activity at PolyU IC is useful to help them better connect AI with their disciplines and future careers. From the students' reflection reports, the experiential learning activities enable the students to connect to their future careers.</p>
